           <h2 id="history"><em><strong> History...</strong></em></h2>
           <p id="ol">In the family of cat breeds, Ragdolls are among the younger siblings. The <br>
               cats were first developed by breeder Ann Baker in Riverside, California, in<br>
               the 1960s. Baker’s foundation stock consisted of Josephine, a domestic <br>
               longhair whose white coat concealed the genes for either a seal mitted or<br>
               black tuxedo pattern, and various other longhaired cats of unknown<br>
               ancestry that she owned or found in her neighborhood.</p>
           
           <p id="ol">Baker selected for cats with gentle, placid personalities, large size, and <br>
               beautiful long coats characterized by a Himalayan pattern, the name for <br>
               the “points” seen on Siamese-type cats. The result was a cat she called the <br>
               Ragdoll, for its propensity to flop happily into the arms of anyone who <br>
               picked it up. Later, Persians, Birmans and Burmese may also have <br>
               contributed to the Ragdoll’s development.</p>
           
           <p id="ol">Baker made many unusual claims about the cats’ development, including<br>
               alien influence, CIA experiments, and infusions of human genes, but that is<br>
               all they are: claims, with no basis in fact. Other people had begun breeding<br>
               Ragdolls as well. They broke away from Baker and formed the Ragdoll<br>
               Fanciers Club International, with the goal of standardizing the breed and <br>
               achieving recognition by cat registries.</p>
           
           <p id="ol">The Cat Fanciers Association began registering the cats in 1993 and gave<br>
               them full recognition in 2000. Most registries now recognize the breed,<br>
               including the American Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat<br>
               Association. Ragdolls are not outcrossed to any other breeds.</p>
